# AntispamTester
Python script for testing antispam functionality

Put AntispamTester.py to the same folder as antispam. E-mails, which are to be tested, should be put in a ./Tests subfolder like this:

- antispam
- AntispamTester
- ./Tests
    - ./[subfolder_name]
        - ./spam
            - spam e-mails
        - ./ham
            - ham e-mails
    - ./[subfolder2_name]
    ...
